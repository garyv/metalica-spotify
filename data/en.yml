  In 1993, the members of Metallica established <br>
  their own unique Club which exists so the band can keep a 
  two-way line of communication open to the people who 
  have supported them over the years. The Club is your ticket 
  to staying up to date about what the band is up to as well as
  interacting with the band you love. 
  Fully owned and operated by the band itself,
  since 1995, Metallica has given Club Members access
  to over 30 gigs that were not available to the general public.  
  That is just one of many bonuses...
